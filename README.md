## Apps to Clone ##

### Suckless.org Clones ###
Suckless has a great view of how to create applications: make them simple, small, and hackable. 
All configuration is completed at compile-time, not runtime. 

- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) / [dwl](https://github.com/djpohly/dwl)
- [st](https://st.suckless.org)
- [surf](https://surf.suckless.org)
  - Servo renderer (maybe the [Servo](https://servo.org) project would be sufficient in and of itself)
  
### Other Apps to Clone ###
- (neo)vim editor
  - No vimscript support
